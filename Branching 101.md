Work multiple things at once 

 

•git branch : list/create branches 

•git checkout -b <branch> : create & switch (older syntax) 

•git switch -c <branch> : modern version 

•git switch <branch> : switch branches safely 

•git branch -d <branch> : delete branch 

git switch is newer and more beginner-friendly. Works only with newer git versions.  

git branch only creates or lists, doesn’t switch 

checkout still works but is multi-purpose and confusing
