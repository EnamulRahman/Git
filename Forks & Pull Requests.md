Cross team collaboration 

 

•Fork = your own copy of someone else’s repo (on GitHub) 

•Clone the forked repo to your local machine 

•Make changes → push to your fork 

•Open a Pull Request (PR) to propose your changes 

•Used in open source and cross-team workflows 

•Original repo owner can review, comment, and merge 

fork the repo on GitHub — it creates a personal copy under your username. Then you clone that to your local machine and work on your changes like normal. 

When you're ready, you push those changes to your fork — not the original — and then open a Pull Request on GitHub. This tells the original repo: “Hey, here’s what I did. Want to merge it in?” 

The owner or maintainer can review your code, leave comments, request changes, or just approve and merge it. 

This is how the entire open-source world runs. It’s safe, reviewable, and tracks everything in the PR history — commits,  

conversations, diffs.
